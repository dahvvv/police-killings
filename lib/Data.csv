A passing stranger helped them change the tire, but the spare was also flat, so the man led them to a filling station. But the tire would not inflate, and so Ms. Miller waited in the car while the man drove her friend home to get assistance from the family. When relatives arrived they found Ms. Miller apparently comatose in the locked car, with the engine running and the radio on. She was shaking bodily and foaming at the mouth, and had a .380 semi-automatic pistol in her lap.[2][3] Unable to wake her they called 9-1-1. Four Police officers arrived at the scene within minutes and, informed by family members of the presence of a gun in the car, approached the vehicle with guns drawn.[3] After attempting for several minutes to get a response from Miller, the decision was made to force entry into the vehicle as Miller was in apparent need of immediate medical attention.[3] As one of the officers was attempting to remove the gun, Miller is said to have sat up and grabbed the weapon at which point the officers opened fire 23 times, hitting Ms. Miller with at least 12 bullets, including four in the head. The officers involved, three white and one Hispanic, were placed on administrative leave. They claimed they had acted in self-defense.

The releasing of the coroner's report prompted protests from the community, who rallied at the police headquarters, demanding an independent investigation, amongst suggestions that institutional racism had played a role.The officers involved were fired from Riverside Police Department but did not face prosecution due to ""insufficient evidence.""

Robert Cameron Redus,23,white,male,,"SAN ANTONIO — University of the Incarnate Word student Cameron Redus, a 23-year-old, was shot five times — including once in the back — during a fatal altercation with a campus police officer last year, according to an autopsy report released Thursday by the Bexar County Medical Examiner's office.

Authorities said the shooting came after a six-minute struggle in the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments in Alamo Heights, where Redus lived.

A toxicology test also showed Redus had a blood alcohol content of .155, nearly twice the legal limit to drive, when authorities say he fought UIW officer Christopher Carter on Dec. 6 in the parking lot of Redus' off-campus apartment complex near Incarnate Word.

The Dec. 7 autopsy conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Peacock found that five bullets had struck Redus in the left eye, upper chest, left elbow, right hip and upper back. The report didn't say which wounds came first, but it concluded that the shot to the back was the “most immediately lethal.”

At a past press conference, Alamo Heights Police Chief Richard Pruitt said Carter was driving on Broadway in a marked UIW police pickup truck when he spotted another truck being driven erratically. It was in the early morning hours of Dec. 6, and Carter saw the truck strike a curb and swerve briefly into the oncoming lanes.

Carter followed the suspected drunken driver. He was outside his jurisdiction, but Carter was a licensed peace officer authorized to arrest DWI suspects anywhere in Texas.

The officer followed Redus and activated the emergency lights of his police truck near the Treehouse Apartments, where Redus parked and got out of his vehicle.

The dash cam of Carter's truck didn't record video of the altercation, but Carter was wearing a microphone that recorded audio. Pruitt said the recording captured Carter asking Redus to stop and put his hands on the truck. Redus complied, but began to struggle when Carter started to handcuff him, Pruitt said.

During the six-minute confrontation, Carter told Redus 14 times to put his hands behind his back and told him three times that he was under arrest, Pruitt said. Carter told Redus to stop resisting 56 times, Pruitt said.

Redus at one point grabbed Carter's police baton and struck the officer with it, authorities said.

Carter regained control of the baton and Redus broke free. Pruitt said Carter drew his handgun, ordered Redus to stop, and Redus charged him with his hand raised. Carter fired six times.

Police say Allen disobeyed them, had reached for something in his pocket and was attempting to roll over, causing Leal to “fear for his own life.” But marks on Allen's hands indicate he had been handcuffed. Two grand jury members said they felt pressured to not indict by a politically connected fellow juror. Both officers were no-billed.
Not only did these cops get away with murder, but the shooter, Officer Leal, has since been promoted within his department. He now supervises everyone who investigated him. The Bellaire Police Dept. basically congratulated him for killing an unarmed teenager.

The car slammed into a garage in the 7400 block of South Emerald Avenue, and the men jumped out and ran, Camden said.

An officer followed one of the men into a dark gangway, where the man jumped out, punched her in the face and grabbed for her gun, Camden said.

As the two struggled, the officer began to feel faint. Fearing she would lose her grip on her gun, the officer shot the man, Camden said.

Anthony Garcia,19,white,male,,"Full disclosure:  I am an attorney for the victim.  The information below is from the police reports and witness statements.  I'd be happy to email the police reports, investigations and witness statements if Deadspin would like to review the evidence itself.

Police were called because a neighbor believed 4 teenagers were smoking pot in an apartment complex's laundry room.  The sheriff's office responded to the call because it was in the unincorporated part of Vista, California.  A 25 year old female, alone, approached the four people.  There was no signs of pot.  Nevertheless, Deputy Storms decided to do a warrant check.  She handcuffed one of the individuals and sat him down on the curb outside the laundry room.  She went to handcuff the victim, who asked why he was being arrested.  She told him to shut up or she would tase him.  He then looked over his shoulder at her and she told him to turn around or she was going to tase him.  She then bear hugged him.  The victim (5'7"" 190lbs  (arrest records indicate 5'8"" 220lbs, of course)), then tried to get away believing he was about to be tased.  He pushed the officer out of the laundry room.  She still had him in the bear hug position as if she was about to suplex him.  The two fell to the ground, Deputy Storms falling on her back.  Witnesses state that the victim never once tried to strike Deputy Storms and was struggling to try to get away.  Deputy Storms discharged her taser during the fracas on the ground and the probes missed the victim but nearly hit the bystanders.  The victim got to his feet and began to run.  While he was at least 30 feet away, Deputy Storms shot him in the back.  The bullet entered about 4"" to the right of the spine, severed the victim's lung, liver and spleen and ultimately came to rest immediately behind his right nipple.  The victim spent weeks in the hospital recovering.

The following day, Deputy Storms said that she looked up from the sidewalk and saw the victim with her taser and believed he was about to shoot her.  The taser was on the ground about 40 feet from the victim at the time he was shot IN THE BACK, something that the journalists and officers doing the investigation fail to address in their coverage.

The fight with Mylo wound up on the ground. The teen initially was on his stomach but managed to roll onto his back. One officer entwined Mylo's legs with his own, a wrestling move known as a reverse grapevine.

The officer grabbed the back of Mylo's head. He pulled down hard, forcing Mylo's chin tight against the teen's own chest. That made it difficult for Mylo to open his mouth and reduced the officers' risk of being bitten by him. They remained in that position while the other officers tried to pin Mylo's arms.

The teen still was talking. Then, officers reported, he suddenly slipped into unconsciousness. Handcuffs were snapped around his wrists. Officers bound his feet with nylon straps. When his family read the reports later, it bothered them that one of the restraints used was the leash a police dog handler had been carrying in her uniform pocket.

Mylo was placed on a paramedic's backboard and strapped down. The officers told the aid crew waiting nearby that Mylo, though unconscious, had a pulse and was still breathing.

The paramedics moved in and quickly realized that wasn't so. They got Mylo's heart pumping and restored his breathing.

Hassan Ibrahim Bazzi,39,unknown,male,,"Police said that Bazzi was pulled over for failing to yield to a fire truck. He was also allegedly driving at high rates of speed and disregarding traffic control devices. Bazzi allegedly drove toward the Dearborn officer who pulled him over and attempted to strike him with his car according to police, which led to the officer firing five shots at Bazzi's car. 
Witnesses at the scene also confirmed they heard five shots that sounded like pistol fire. 
Bazzi was not hit by the shots and continued driving and crashed into another vehicle shortly afterward, ending up in front of the ACCESS sign where clothes and several other items were strewn all over the middle of Schaefer Road. 
After the crash, Bazzi attempted to flee and was captured by officers. Both Bazzi and the arresting officer suffered minor injuries according to Dearborn Police and were treated at a local hospital. According to Majed Moughni, a Dearborn-based attorney who has agreed to take on Bazzi's case pro bono, Bazzi was suffering from schizophrenia at the time and was not taking his medication, which may have caused him to have a fearful, irrational reaction.
Moughni also said that the shots were aimed at the backseat of Bazzi's car. The debris scattered all over the road was likely from his car, which he had been living out of according to Moughni. Bazzi had originally offered to pay Moughni with food stamps to defend him. 
Moughni also said that a witness told him that Bazzi was ""beaten up pretty well"" by police after he attempted to flee. 
No matter what happens in the meantime, the likely final outcome is that Bazzi, a Lebanese immigrant, is deported, said Moughni. With Bazzi's previous felony conviction and a laundry list of new felonies pending against him, immigration authori-ties have issued a prisoner hold, meaning that even if he posts the $300,000 bond for this case, he will remain in custody to be dealt with by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Bazzi, 39, immigrated in 1991 and is a legal resident, Moughni said.

Asked what is his goal for his client in this case, Moughni said, “to have him deported as soon as possible so that taxpayers don't have to pay unnecessary costs.”

Marquise Jones,23,black or african american,male,,"SAN ANTONIO — A driver in a crash that led to an officer-involved shooting last week at a drive through refused to turn off his car when ordered to and was arrested on outstanding municipal court warrants, according to a police report released Wednesday.

Fabian Garza, 21, was driving a 1994 Cadillac El Dorado that rear-ended a white SUV early Friday in the drive-through of Chacho's, in the 8600 block of Perrin Beitel Road on the Northeast Side.

Garza tried to back up and leave the scene of the 1 a.m. wreck, according to police. The SUV's driver, whose identity is unknown, “exchanged words” with the people in the Cadillac and left the scene, according to police.

A witness told Officer Robert Encina of the San Antonio Police Department about the incident and added . Encina was in full uniform working an off-duty security job at the restaurant, of the incident, adding that the people in the Cadillac seemed intoxicated.

The witness said the officer repeatedly asked Garza to turn off the car and step outside the car. Garza and his passenger Marquise Jones, 23, were not following Encina's orders and Jones seemed to be reaching for something in the car, the witness told police.

Encina was able to turn off the car himself, and put the keys on the roof while trying to handcuff Garza, according to police.

At that point, police said Jones got out of the passenger door and pulled a revolver from the area of his waist, turning to look at Encina.

The witness said Encina then fired shots.

Jones started to run westward before collapsing, according to the police report.

An arriving officer found Jones lying face down toward Perrin Beitel road with a gunshot wound on the left side of his back. He was not breathing and was pronounced dead within minutes, according to police.

Chase Houston,28,white,male,,"On Dec. 3, 2013, at 2:00 p.m., Pierce County Sheriff's deputies attempted to perform a welfare check on Houston at a garage-style storage unit near 216th Street and State Route 7 in Spanaway. Houston's family told the deputies that Houston was living in the storage unit, was making irrational comments over the phone and on social networks, and was high on methamphetamine and armed. Deputies called Houston, and Houston said he would kill them and anyone else who tried to contact him.

The SWAT team was called in and a negotiator was able to talk Houston into coming out of the unit. Houston partially opened the garage door, but refused to cooperate with the SWAT team's commands to put his hands on his head and turn around. SWAT members fired non-lethal projectiles at Houston in an attempt to subdue him, but the projectiles had no effect on Houston. He went back inside the unit and closed the door.

To prevent Houston from using his car that was parked in front of the door, SWAT members attempted to tow it away. As the team was hooking a cable to the vehicle, Houston began firing a gun through the garage door. One SWAT member was struck in the arm. Two other team members returned gunfire through the door with their rifles. The gunfire inside the storage unit stopped.

Team members attempted to contact Houston, but were unsuccessful. They entered the storage unit and found Houston deceased on the floor with a handgun and expended casings next to him.

According to Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Clark, Houston died from a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Dr. Clark also determined Houston had methamphetamines, marijuana and oxycodone in his system at the time of his death.

Investigators also identified sheriff's Sgt. Manuel Diaz, a 20-year department veteran, as the lawman who shot and killed Craig Petersen, 52, a general contractor suspected of fatally stabbing a 71-year-old Borrego Springs resident.

Sheriff's homicide unit Sgt. Roy Frank released new details on the case Thursday, saying Petersen went to the home of George Mendenhall, on Borrego Hills Road, about 6:30 or 6:45 a.m. Wednesday “regarding some tools.”

After Petersen left, a female member of Mendenhall's family found Mendenhall in the garage, bleeding, about 7 a.m. He had been stabbed several times in the chest, and died a short time later, Frank said.

“The motive is still under investigation,” Frank said. “We are finalizing interviews to try to find out what the motive was.”

At least one witness provided deputies with information that Petersen was the suspect in the slaying. Deputies then launched a manhunt for him across the small desert community.

Petersen lived in a Borrego Springs trailer park and had known Mendenhall for about 10 years, Frank said.

About 1 p.m., Diaz was on patrol in the area of Japatul Valley and Descanso when he saw a light blue Ford F150 pickup in the Park and Ride lot at Interstate 8 and state Route 79.

Rafael Alonso Olivas,23,unknown,male,,"Three Metro Police officers fatally shot a 23-year-old man wielding a butcher knife Thursday morning in a western Las Vegas Valley neighborhood.

Police responded at 6:46 a.m. to the report of a domestic disturbance on Musical Lane near the intersection of Firestone Drive and Westcliff Drive. That location is southwest of the Buffalo Drive and Summerlin Parkway interchange.

Metro Police Capt. Patrick Neville said a woman reported she was having an argument with her son and that he was out of control.

Police arrived and found a man with a butcher knife walking southbound on Firestone Drive. Neville said the man approached officers after authorities made several commands for him to stop.

The officers then discharged non-lethal rounds at the man, striking him four times, in an attempt to get him to stop, but the man continued toward officers with the knife, Neville said.

""Officers feared for their lives,"" he said.

The three officers then fired multiple shots at the man, who was pronounced dead at University Medical Center. Neville said he didn't know how close the officers were to the man when they opened fire.

Victor Chavez, the man's cousin, identified the man who was killed as Rafael Olivas.

Chavez, 21, described his cousin's relationship with his mother as fairly typical, with arguments only once in a while.

“I still can't believe it,” he said. “It hasn't set in.”

Chavez said one of the last times he saw Olivas — known as “Ralfy” to relatives — was during a party for a younger family member. Olivas lived with his mother and has several siblings, he said.

Police said the mother wasn't injured during the argument with her son. It wasn't immediately clear whether other family members were home at the time or what led to the argument.

“All I heard was he had a knife,” said Chavez, who rushed to join family at the scene after the shooting. “That's no reason to be shot four times.”

The three officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. Their names will be released in 48 hours.

The police dog attacked without command, forcing the assaulting officer toward the victim. The officer then fired. The victim was a criminal justice student who was in possession of a licensed concealed weapon.",,false,,30.2240897,-92.0198427,"Lafayette, LA, USA",lafayette,LA,,lafayette parish,unknown,http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2014/10/29/mason-family-wants-justice-police-shooting-lawsuit/18143969/,U.S. Police Shootings Data

Thomas Read,36,white,male,,"Although a man with a knife, making threats towards police officers seems justifiable (per se) the amount of time the officers spent at the scene is alarming.  According to the reports, the police were called to the scene ""just before 9:30"" and another report from a first responder at 9:46 describes a man with multiple gunshot wounds. The investigation is ongoing with ""no timetable"" for completion.  The man may have attacked the officers once they entered the house making the death justifiable, but in my mind, it seems the police were a bit to willing to go into the home and confront the armed man (all purely speculative on my part).  It has been reported that he lived alone and I couldn't find any mention of the police finding anyone else in the home.  No hostage, which seems to lend to the general thought that the police had no reason to enter the home without trying a little harder to get the man to surrender peacefully.  My opinion, of course.
